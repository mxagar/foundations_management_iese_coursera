# Foundations of Management - IESE / Coursera

This repository contains my personal notes on the Coursera Specialization by IESE ["Foundations on Management"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/foundations-management).

The Specialization is composed of five courses, divided in each of the subfolders of the repository:

1. [Accounting: Principles of Financial Accounting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting?specialization=foundations-management)
2. [Finance for Managers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/operational-finance?specialization=foundations-management)
3. [Marketing: Customer Needs and Wants](https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-customers?specialization=foundations-management)
4. [Organizational Behavior: How to Manage People](https://www.coursera.org/learn/managing-people-iese?specialization=foundations-management)
5. [Analysis of Business Problems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analysis-business-problem-iese?specialization=foundations-management)

In addition, I have also followed related courses. The notes are located in another repository: [finance_accounting_courses](https://github.com/mxagar/finance_accounting_courses)
