# Principles of Accounting

These are my notes on the Coursera course [Accounting: Principles of Financial Accounting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting?specialization=foundations-management), taught by Prof. Marc Badia.

The course explains in 4 weeks the 3 most important finance reports (balance, income, cash-flow) and explains additionally accrual accounting.

Overview:
1. Introduction
2. The Balance Sheet
3. The Income Statement
4. The Cash Flow Statement
5. Accrual Accounting

## 1. Introduction

Accounting is known as "the language of business".

The companz managers are the ones which record all economic events and transactions according to some standards and present it to interested parties. These interested parties are many:
- Current shareholders
- Potential shareholders
- Own comany workers who would like to negotiate their salary
- Customers who look for long-term product support
- Competitors
- ...

There is a conflict of interest: the company managers prepare the accounting reports and these are incentivized if the company shows to performs well; therefore, it is in their favor to show good reports. Hence, external auditors are required to supervise and certify that the reports are correct.
