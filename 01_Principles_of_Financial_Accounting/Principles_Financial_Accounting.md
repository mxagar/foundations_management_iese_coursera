## 1. Introduction

Accounting is known as "the language of business".

The company managers are the ones which record all economic events and transactions according to some standards and present it to interested parties. These interested parties are many:
- Current shareholders
- Potential shareholders
- Own company workers who would like to negotiate their salary
- Customers who look for long-term product support
- Competitors
- ...

There is a conflict of interest: the company managers prepare the accounting reports and these are incentivized if the company shows to performs well; therefore, it is in their favor to show good reports. Hence, external auditors are required to supervise and certify that the reports are correct.

## 2. The Balance Sheet
### 2.1. Bookstore Case

We have the following case, taken from the PDF downloaded from the course:

1. On December 1st, Cristina incorporates the Campus Bookstore and together with her uncle, they contribute €50,000 of capital to the business.
2. Cristina negotiates a loan with the bank. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore receives a three-year bank loan of €20,000. The full amount of the principal has to be repaid at the end of the third year.
3. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore purchases furniture and equipment for €25,000 (€15,000 paid in cash and the rest to be paid in the coming year).
4. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore acquires a bookstore management software for €3,000 paid in cash.
5. On December 15th, the Campus Bookstore purchases books on credit for a total amount of €40,000.
6. On December 31st, Cristina signs a one-year lease for the premises of the Campus Bookstore. The lease will start on January 1st and will end on December 31st of year x1. The Campus Bookstore prepays €6,000 for the full year rent.

Every business has a business cycle:

![The Business Cycle](./pics/business_cycle.png)

Cristina, the bookstore owner says she has all the receipts of the payments she's done.
However, keeping track of all the payment receipts is not enough, because

- it does not reflect the full value of assets, only what has been paid for in cash
- it does not include how much money is owed
- it doesn't specify where the money is coming from (sources of capital)

![Cash receipt accounting](./pics/cash_receipt_accounting.png)

### 2.2. Double Entry Accounting

In order to overcome the issues or lacks faced by a payments-based accounting, the **double entry accounting** is used in a table with two sides: **(1, right) the sources of capital and (2, left) uses of that capital**.

Main idea: any money entry on the right needs to reflect the use of that money on the left. Each side of the table is divided in different accounts. Thus, for every value transaction, at least 2 accounts need to be updated; however, these not always will be on different sides of the table.

![Double entry accounting](./pics/double_accounting.png)

In the following, all the 6 transactions/payments carried out to open the bookstore are reflected in the table and commented:

<!--- ![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts.png) -->
![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_comments.jpeg)

If we make the sum of each account and display the summary, we have our **balance sheet**, which is th emost important financial statement:

![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_summary.png)

Note the following points:
- We have created **accounts** on both sides of the table:
  - Cash
  - Inventory
  - Equipment
  - Rent
  - Software
  - Loan
  - Common stock / Share capital
  - ...
- The sum on both sides of the table must be the same
- On entry in an account needs at least another entry in another account, which might be on the same side or on the other side
### 2.3. The Balance Sheet

The two-sided table is **the balance sheet**.
It is the most important financial statement because it shows a complete image of the state of the company.
It is also called the **statement of the finance position**.
We can see that the accounts of the balance sheet can be classified in very clear types of accounts:

- Source of money (right): **Liabilities and Owner's Equity**
  - **Current liabilities (CL)**: liabilities are sources of capital **that we need to return** before the **maturity date**, in the case of current liabilities we often need to return them within a year
  - **Non-current liabilities (NCL)**: liabilities that we need to return, but later than within a year
  - **Owner's equity (OE)**: sources that we don't need to return
- Use of money (left): **Assets**
  - **Current assets (CA)**: they are cash or they are going to become cash in the near term (months)
  - **Non-current assets (NCA)**: assets that are not going to become money (in the short run). These are the long-term resources.

**Accounting identity**: `A = L + OE`
**Net Assets**: `NA = A - L = CA + NCA - CL - NCL =  OE`

Note on the current liabilities/assets: *current* refers often to the next 12 months, but it can be longer if the business' operating cycle is longer (e.g., a winery, which needs 2 years to produce wine). Additionally, we might have liabilities/assets that are due in the short-term (months/weeks) not in 12 months.

Valuation can be:
- Historical cost: the value at purchase time
- Current value: aka fair or market value, the present cost if sold

Usually, historical costs are registered in the balance sheet, but recently the use of current value has extended; it has pros and cons.

![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_summary_2.png)

The order of the accounts is relevant:

- Anglosaxon style (USA):
  - Assets: most liquidity on top, less at the bottom
  - Liabilities and owner's equity: closer maturity on top, less or non maturity (no need to return) at the bottom
- Continental European style: opposite order as USA
- UK & Ireland: one column

![The Balance Sheet Format](./pics/balance_sheet_order.png)

### 2.4. Interpretation of the Balance Sheet

The different account categories/types are related:

- Non-current assets are our long-term assets; they are related with the long-term liabilities, which are the non-current liabilities and the owner's equity. We check that our long-term resources (28k) can be fully payed by the long-term liabilities (70k); in other words, with the money we do not need to return at least within a year we can assure that our equipment and long-run assets are financed.
- Similarly, we check that our current assets (cash, inventory to be sold shortly, etc.) are able to cover our current liabilities (immediate debts that are to be paid shortly): 92k > 50k.
  - **Working capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.

Thus, we conclude that the status of the bookstore overall is good.

However, there are some unknown points yet:

- Inventory: right now, we have the purchase cost of the goods to be sold;  when are we going to sell the books? at which pace? at which price? will that be enough?
- The company doesn't own buildings/lands, but they rent them. If they owned them, they would have needed much more sources of capital.

### 2.5. Assets

In accounting, an asset is defined by three elements:

1. An asset is a **resource owned or controlled by the firm**. The furniture & equipment are ours.
2. An asset is expected to **generate future economic benefits**.
3. An asset is the **result of a past event or transaction**.

Additionally, we have two conditions to acknowledge an asset:

- The **value needs to be estimated reliably**.
- The future **economic benefits need to have high probability**.

Every time we add an asset we need to check those 3+2 points. If we have a good which does not fulfill any of the points but is of considerable value, we disclose it in a note. The management needs to address cases of doubt; for instance, we could doubt whether a newly discovered tech is an asset, because its future economic impact is unsure.

Examples of assets:

- Equipment of 1M euros: fulfills all 5 points
- Diet Coke brand: it is not an asset, because it is nt the result of a past transaction, but an internal creation process.
- Lottery tickets: it is not an asset, because the probability of future benefits is low.
- Employees: they are not assets, because they are not owned by the company! However, there is an exception here: Sports clubs like FC Barcelona. These clubs have often in their assets something called *transfer rights*. A transfer right is tied to a player and it gives the permission to the club so that the player plays with them for a given amount of time. For instance, Suárez went from Liverpool to Barcelona and Barcelona payer the transfer fee to Liverpool for that; as such, that fee is in the assets list, because it fulfills all 5 points. However, Mesi, a Barcelona player discovered brought up and trained within Barcelona, has not a transfer fee within Barcelona assets list, because there is not a past transaction tied to him.

#### 2.5.1 Most Common Assets (from the readings)

**Current Assets**:
- Cash: the most liquid asset
- Short-term investments (bonds, shares, etc.)
- Account receivable: amounts owed by customers
- Inventories: purchased products, held for sale. Manufacturing companies have three types
  1. Raw materials
  2. Work in progress inventory: products in production
  3. Finished inventory: products for sale
- Prepaid expenses: insurance, rent, etc.
- Interest receivable: interest earned, not yet received
- Taxes receivable: taxes not yet refunded
- Non-current assets held for sale (they become current assets)

**Non-Current Assets**:
- Property, plant, equipment (inmobilizado material): land, buildings, machines, vehicles, etc. (tools that are not intended for sell, but for doing business). Noten that the same thing could be considered current/non-current for different companies. Often times the (accumulated) depreciation is added in the summary balance sheet below the property/equipment account.
- Deferred tax assets: income taxes recoverable in the future, later than in a year
- Intangible assets: patents, trademarks, copyrights; amortization is needed (amotization = depreciation for intangile assets).
- Financial investments
- Goodwill: value that arises whena  firm acquires another firm: growth opportunities, know-how, etc. No amortization is done, but impariment test can be done if the Goodwill has lost its value.

### 2.6. Liabilities

In accounting, a liability is defined by two elements:

1. A liability is a present **obligation of the firm to transfer economic benefits in the future to another party**. Example: a loan.
2. A liability is the **result of a past event or transaction**. The obligation to repay originates from this past transaction.
3. The settlement which is expected will **cause an outflow of economic benefit**.

Additionally, as with assets, we have two conditions to acknowledge a liability:

- The **value transferred (outflow) needs to be estimated/measured reliably**.
- Liabilities need to be **repaid with have high probability**. We have probable outflows of benefits.

As with the assets, if we have a possible liability which does not fulfill any of the points, it is not considered a liability; however, it is disclosed if it has a considerable value.

Examples:

- A bank loan: it is a clear liability.
- Law suit: a company is likely to lose a law suit, but we cannot estimate the penalty. Since there is no clear estimation, we do not add it to the liabilities, but we disclose it in the footnotes of the balance sheet!
- A company sells cars with 3-year warranties. It is a liability, because the warranty contract fulfills the 4 points; we estimate the amount of warranty contracts which are exercised out of past experience/years. This kind of liabilities for which their amounts need to be predicted in that manner are called **provisions**.
- Future salaries: they are not liabilities, because they are future obligations or commitments for work that has not been done yet.

#### 2.6.1 Most Common Liabilities (from the readings)

**Current Liabilities:**
- Accounts payable: amounts owed to suppliers, etc.
- Salaries, Utilities payable, Interest payable; also known as accrued expenses
- Advances from customers, Deferred/Unearned revenue: goods or services not yet delivered
- Short-term, loans
- Notes payable: like accounts payable, but formalized with contacts (and often with interest).
- Provisions: liabilities for which value/cost and maturity are unknown, e.g., costs for warranty repairs
- Current portion of long-term loans: the part of a loan that needs to be repaid regularly (not the interest), e.g., the monthly mortgage fee - interests.

**Non-Current Liabilities:**
- Long-term loans, mortgages
- Pension obligations: payable when employees retire
- Provisions for restructuring costs
- Provisions for legal issues  litigation
- Capital lease obligations: amounts owed because of renting stuff
- Deferred tax liabilities: income tax payable in the future

### 2.7 Owners' Equity (extra, after the readings)

The Owners' Equity is the wealth of the owners of the firm. Two parts:
- Capital contributed by them
- Earnings generated by the operations and retained in the firm

It is often derived from the accounting identity:

`OE = A - L`

#### 2.7.1 Most Common Owners' Equity

- Share capital / Common stock: par or nominal value x number of shares; the nominal value is an arbitrary value that does not need to be the value paid by investors. If the company is not in the markets, the share capital is the money put by the investors, often the founders.
- Share premium or Additional paid in capital: price in excess of the nominal values which reaches the total price paid for each share by market investors.
- Preferred shares / stock: shares with additional voting rights
- Retained earnings / profits: earnings of current and past periods not distributed to owners
- Accummulated other comprehensive income / Reserves: gains or losses in addition to the retained earning, for instance when financial assets increase in value
- Non-controlling interests: equity interests of minority shareholders in companies controlled by the firm

### 2.8 Readings

#### 2.8.1 `Accounting_01_Introduction.pdf` (p. 1-15)

**Very important case study** in which the balance sheet is built with much more transactions as in the videos.

General notes:

- Managerial accounting vs financial accounting: first for inside firm, second for interested parties outside the company
- Annual report: summary of yearly financial status, public, audited, for for interested parties outside the company
- Balance sheet
  - Sources of capital (right)
    - Liabilties: `L`: current and non-current
    - Owners' equity: `OE`
  - Use of capital (left)
    - Assets: `A`: current and non-current
- Accounting idetity: `A = L + OE`
  - Or: `OE = A - L`: owned wealth is the residual after we substract to our resources the funds we need to return
  - `A - L = OE = NA`: aka net assets

**Case study:** DSJ company creation and operations over time (**very complete introductory example**):

- Usually, the balance sheet is presented every year or quarterly; therefore, we add an account in OE called **profit of the period**, which accounts for the revenues and expenses (i.e., profits).
- The balance sheet contains a summary of all transactions.
- When we pay the rent for a given time frame, this reduces the **cash** (assets), but it increases the account **prepaid rent** (assets), as the physical place is a resource we use!
- When we **sell** merchandise/goods, the revenues go to the account **profit of the period** (OE), and several things happen additionally:
  - If we sell merchandise/goods in cash, the received money goes to the cash account (assets).
  - If we sell on credit its value goes to an assets account called **accounts receivable** (in assets), not to the cash account; this way, it is clear we do not have the money yet.
  - Additionally we need to reflect the **costs of goods sold** (COGS) to keep a balance in the balance sheet: the **inventory** account (assets) needs to be decreased in the value of the associated cost and the **profit of the period** (OE) also decreased by the costs; this way, we have the real profits in the account **profit of the period**, not the revenue!
  - These steps are done often in separate entries because receiving the money and delivering the goods are separate events, and the amount of capital **in** the company is better portrayed that way.
- When we sell goods but we deliver them later, the revenues do not go to the **profits** account!
  - We register the increase in cash (assets).
  - We open/register the account **deposits from customers/unearned renevue** (liabilities).
- The contributed capital and the earned capital need to be well distinguished in the OE section.
- Expenses, if not tied to other assets, cause a decrease in two accounts
    1. **cash**
    2. **profit of the period**: here we usually add a note to the type of expense
- Updates of assets in the period:
  - Equipment: Depreciation of equipment is registered as an expense. Usually, the monthly fee is: `cost / useful life expentancy in months`; then we multiply it by the months in the period (usually 3 months, i.e., a quarter). Often the summary balance sheet contains an entry with the accumulated depreciation below the equipment cost value.
  - Prepaid rents: if we have a prepair rent for 6 months, this is reflected as an asset; however, after 3 months (period), its value has halved, and wee need to reflect it in two accounts
    1. prepaid rent (assets)
    2. profit
- Interests and Taxes to be payed
  - Even though interests and taxes can be required to be paid at year end, every period we need to account for them and change two accounts:
  1. **interests payable** / **taxes payable** (liabilities)
  2. profit (OE)
  - This is another example in which the recognition of an expense does not require cash outflow!

![DSJ Company: Transactions in first period of company since foundation](./pics/dsj_transactions.png)

Usually balance sheets are presented in two consecutive periods to analyze the development.

![DSJ Company: Balance sheet after the first period](./pics/dsj_balance_sheets.png)

The OE account **profit of the period** renamed to be the account of **retained profits**: this is a very important value, since it summarizes how well the company did in the period! Since it is very important, a new table/statement is created for it: **The Income Statement** or **Profit & Loss account (P & L)**. This table is basically the list of all transactions (or groups of transactions) in the account **profit of the period**. The order matters: revenues are decreased from most basic expenses to taxes until we get the net profit:

1. **Sales revenue**: everything we have earned
2. **Gross profit** = sales revenue - COGS expenses
3. **Operating profit** = Gross profit - operation expenses
   - Operation expenses: salaries, depreciation, rent, etc.
4. **Profit before income tax** = Operating profit - interest expenses
5. **Net profit** = Profit before income tax - income tax
   - Income tax (= impuesto de sociedades) is applied on the profits after all expenses except the taxes; it is different for each countries, and it varies depending on the size and activities of the company

Note that the shareholders can obtain **dividends** from the **net profit**.
Since the dividends are not an expense, they do not appear in the income statement; however, they are reflected in the balance sheet, because they are part of the financial image of the company: **Cash** (assets) and **Profit of the period / Retained profit** are decreased with the amount payed in dividends.

That explains why **profit of the period** is renamed to **retained profits** in the income statement: the income statement accounts for the profits generated (revenues - expenses), independently of how they are distributed.

![DSJ Company: Income statement after the first period](./pics/dsj_income_statement.png)

How a basic financial analysis is done:
- Check **balance sheet**
  - How big is the net profit?
  - How are `A`, `L` and `OE` distributed?
  - Do current assets pay the current liabilities?
    - If our cash is able to pay all current liabilities, that's perfect; but not necessary
    - Same question is applied to non-current assets vs liabilities
- Check the **income statement**
  - How was the net profit obtained?
  - `Profit margin = Net profit / Sales`: how big is it?
  - `Return on equity (ROE) = Net profit / OE`: how big is it? (4x for annualized return)

#### 2.8.2 `Accounting_02_BalanceSheet.pdf`

All new concepts are integrated in the notes above.
The PDF provides three interesting real-life examples of balance sheets, each in one of the formats (Anglosaxon, European, UK):
- Walmart Stores
- Metro Group
- J Salisbury plc

Have a look at them!!
