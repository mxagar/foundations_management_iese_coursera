## 1. Introduction

Accounting is known as "the language of business".

The company managers are the ones which record all economic events and transactions according to some standards and present it to interested parties. These interested parties are many:
- Current shareholders
- Potential shareholders
- Own company workers who would like to negotiate their salary
- Customers who look for long-term product support
- Competitors
- ...

There is a conflict of interest: the company managers prepare the accounting reports and these are incentivized if the company shows to performs well; therefore, it is in their favor to show good reports. Hence, external auditors are required to supervise and certify that the reports are correct.

## 2. The Balance Sheet
### 2.1. Bookstore Case

We have the following case, taken from the PDF downloaded from the course:

1. On December 1st, Cristina incorporates the Campus Bookstore and together with her uncle, they contribute €50,000 of capital to the business.
2. Cristina negotiates a loan with the bank. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore receives a three-year bank loan of €20,000. The full amount of the principal has to be repaid at the end of the third year.
3. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore purchases furniture and equipment for €25,000 (€15,000 paid in cash and the rest to be paid in the coming year).
4. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore acquires a bookstore management software for €3,000 paid in cash.
5. On December 15th, the Campus Bookstore purchases books on credit for a total amount of €40,000.
6. On December 31st, Cristina signs a one-year lease for the premises of the Campus Bookstore. The lease will start on January 1st and will end on December 31st of year x1. The Campus Bookstore prepays €6,000 for the full year rent.

Every business has a business cycle:

![The Business Cycle](./pics/business_cycle.png)

Cristina, the bookstore owner says she has all the receipts of the payments she's done.
However, keeping track of all the payment receipts is not enough, because

- it does not reflect the full value of assets, only what has been paid for in cash
- it does not include how much money is owed
- it doesn't specify where the money is coming from (sources of capital)

![Cash receipt accounting](./pics/cash_receipt_accounting.png)

### 2.2. Double Entry Accounting

In order to overcome the issues or lacks faced by a payments-based accounting, the **double entry accounting** is used in a table with two sides: **(1, right) the sources of capital and (2, left) uses of that capital**.

Main idea: any money entry on the right needs to reflect the use of that money on the left. Each side of the table is divided in different accounts. Thus, for every value transaction, at least 2 accounts need to be updated; however, these not always will be on different sides of the table.

![Double entry accounting](./pics/double_accounting.png)

In the following, all the 6 transactions/payments carried out to open the bookstore are reflected in the table and commented:

<!--- ![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts.png) -->
![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_comments.jpeg)

If we make the sum of each account and display the summary, we have our **balance sheet**, which is th emost important financial statement:

![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_summary.png)

Note the following points:
- We have created **accounts** on both sides of the table:
  - Cash
  - Inventory
  - Equipment
  - Rent
  - Software
  - Loan
  - Common stock / Share capital
  - ...
- The sum on both sides of the table must be the same
- On entry in an account needs at least another entry in another account, which might be on the same side or on the other side
### 2.3. The Balance Sheet

The two-sided table is **the balance sheet**.
It is the most important financial statement because it shows a complete image of the state of the company.
It is also called the **statement of the finance position**.
We can see that the accounts of the balance sheet can be classified in very clear types of accounts:

- Source of money (right): **Liabilities and Owner's Equity**
  - **Current liabilities (CL)**: liabilities are sources of capital **that we need to return** before the **maturity date**, in the case of current liabilities we often need to return them within a year
  - **Non-current liabilities (NCL)**: liabilities that we need to return, but later than within a year
  - **Owner's equity (OE)**: sources that we don't need to return
- Use of money (left): **Assets**
  - **Current assets (CA)**: they are cash or they are going to become cash in the near term (months)
  - **Non-current assets (NCA)**: assets that are not going to become money (in the short run). These are the long-term resources.

**Accounting identity**: `A = L + OE`
**Net Assets**: `NA = A - L = CA + NCA - CL - NCL =  OE`

Note on the current liabilities/assets: *current* refers often to the next 12 months, but it can be longer if the business' operating cycle is longer (e.g., a winery, which needs 2 years to produce wine). Additionally, we might have liabilities/assets that are due in the short-term (months/weeks) not in 12 months.

Valuation can be:
- Historical cost: the value at purchase time
- Current value: aka fair or market value, the present cost if sold

Usually, historical costs are registered in the balance sheet, but recently the use of current value has extended; it has pros and cons.

![Double entry accounting](./pics/bookstore_accounts_summary_2.png)

The order of the accounts is relevant:

- Anglosaxon style (USA):
  - Assets: most liquidity on top, less at the bottom
  - Liabilities and owner's equity: closer maturity on top, less or non maturity (no need to return) at the bottom
- Continental European style: opposite order as USA
- UK & Ireland: one column

![The Balance Sheet Format](./pics/balance_sheet_order.png)

### 2.4. Interpretation of the Balance Sheet

The different account categories/types are related:

- Non-current assets are our long-term assets; they are related with the long-term liabilities, which are the non-current liabilities and the owner's equity. We check that our long-term resources (28k) can be fully payed by the long-term liabilities (70k); in other words, with the money we do not need to return at least within a year we can assure that our equipment and long-run assets are financed.
- Similarly, we check that our current assets (cash, inventory to be sold shortly, etc.) are able to cover our current liabilities (immediate debts that are to be paid shortly): 92k > 50k.
  - **Working capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.

Thus, we conclude that the status of the bookstore overall is good.

However, there are some unknown points yet:

- Inventory: right now, we have the purchase cost of the goods to be sold;  when are we going to sell the books? at which pace? at which price? will that be enough?
- The company doesn't own buildings/lands, but they rent them. If they owned them, they would have needed much more sources of capital.

**Important note: in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 there is a deeper interpretation guideline!**

### 2.5. Assets

In accounting, an asset is defined by three elements:

1. An asset is a **resource owned or controlled by the firm**. The furniture & equipment are ours.
2. An asset is expected to **generate future economic benefits**.
3. An asset is the **result of a past event or transaction**.

Additionally, we have two conditions to acknowledge an asset:

- The **value needs to be estimated reliably**.
- The future **economic benefits need to have high probability**.

Every time we add an asset we need to check those 3+2 points. If we have a good which does not fulfill any of the points but is of considerable value, we disclose it in a note. The management needs to address cases of doubt; for instance, we could doubt whether a newly discovered tech is an asset, because its future economic impact is unsure.

Examples of assets:

- Equipment of 1M euros: fulfills all 5 points
- Diet Coke brand: it is not an asset, because it is nt the result of a past transaction, but an internal creation process.
- Lottery tickets: it is not an asset, because the probability of future benefits is low.
- Employees: they are not assets, because they are not owned by the company! However, there is an exception here: Sports clubs like FC Barcelona. These clubs have often in their assets something called *transfer rights*. A transfer right is tied to a player and it gives the permission to the club so that the player plays with them for a given amount of time. For instance, Suárez went from Liverpool to Barcelona and Barcelona payer the transfer fee to Liverpool for that; as such, that fee is in the assets list, because it fulfills all 5 points. However, Mesi, a Barcelona player discovered brought up and trained within Barcelona, has not a transfer fee within Barcelona assets list, because there is not a past transaction tied to him.

#### 2.5.1 Most Common Assets (from the readings)

**Current Assets**:
- Cash: the most liquid asset
- Short-term investments (bonds, shares, etc.)
- Account receivable: amounts owed by customers
- Inventories: purchased products, held for sale. Manufacturing companies have three types
  1. Raw materials
  2. Work in progress inventory: products in production
  3. Finished inventory: products for sale
- Prepaid expenses: insurance, rent, etc.
- Interest receivable: interest earned, not yet received
- Taxes receivable: taxes not yet refunded
- Non-current assets held for sale (they become current assets)

**Non-Current Assets**:
- Property, plant, equipment (inmobilizado material): land, buildings, machines, vehicles, etc. (tools that are not intended for sell, but for doing business). Noten that the same thing could be considered current/non-current for different companies. Often times the (accumulated) depreciation is added in the summary balance sheet below the property/equipment account.
- Deferred tax assets: income taxes recoverable in the future, later than in a year
- Intangible assets: patents, trademarks, copyrights; amortization is needed (amotization = depreciation for intangile assets).
- Financial investments
- Goodwill: value that arises when a firm acquires another firm: growth opportunities, know-how, etc. No amortization is done, but impairment test can be done if the Goodwill has lost its value.

### 2.6. Liabilities

In accounting, a liability is defined by two elements:

1. A liability is a present **obligation of the firm to transfer economic benefits in the future to another party**. Example: a loan.
2. A liability is the **result of a past event or transaction**. The obligation to repay originates from this past transaction.
3. The settlement which is expected will **cause an outflow of economic benefit**.

Additionally, as with assets, we have two conditions to acknowledge a liability:

- The **value transferred (outflow) needs to be estimated/measured reliably**.
- Liabilities need to be **repaid with have high probability**. We have probable outflows of benefits.

As with the assets, if we have a possible liability which does not fulfill any of the points, it is not considered a liability; however, it is disclosed if it has a considerable value.

Examples:

- A bank loan: it is a clear liability.
- Law suit: a company is likely to lose a law suit, but we cannot estimate the penalty. Since there is no clear estimation, we do not add it to the liabilities, but we disclose it in the footnotes of the balance sheet!
- A company sells cars with 3-year warranties. It is a liability, because the warranty contract fulfills the 4 points; we estimate the amount of warranty contracts which are exercised out of past experience/years. This kind of liabilities for which their amounts need to be predicted in that manner are called **provisions**.
- Future salaries: they are not liabilities, because they are future obligations or commitments for work that has not been done yet.

#### 2.6.1 Most Common Liabilities (from the readings)

**Current Liabilities:**
- Accounts payable: amounts owed to suppliers, etc.
- Salaries, Utilities payable, Interest payable; also known as accrued expenses
- Advances from customers, Deferred/Unearned revenue: goods or services not yet delivered
- Short-term, loans
- Notes payable: like accounts payable, but formalized with contacts (and often with interest).
- Provisions: liabilities for which value/cost and maturity are unknown, e.g., costs for warranty repairs
- Current portion of long-term loans: the part of a loan that needs to be repaid regularly (not the interest), e.g., the monthly mortgage fee - interests.

**Non-Current Liabilities:**
- Long-term loans, mortgages
- Pension obligations: payable when employees retire
- Provisions for restructuring costs
- Provisions for legal issues  litigation
- Capital lease obligations: amounts owed because of renting stuff
- Deferred tax liabilities: income tax payable in the future

### 2.7 Owners' Equity (extra, after the readings)

The Owners' Equity is the wealth of the owners of the firm. Two parts:
- Capital contributed by them
- Earnings generated by the operations and retained in the firm

It is often derived from the accounting identity:

`OE = A - L`

#### 2.7.1 Most Common Owners' Equity

- Share capital / Common stock: par or nominal value x number of shares; the nominal value is an arbitrary value that does not need to be the value paid by investors. If the company is not in the markets, the share capital is the money put by the investors, often the founders.
- Share premium or Additional paid in capital: price in excess of the nominal values which reaches the total price paid for each share by market investors.
- Preferred shares / stock: shares with additional voting rights
- Retained earnings / profits: earnings of current and past periods not distributed to owners
- Accummulated other comprehensive income / Reserves: gains or losses in addition to the retained earning, for instance when financial assets increase in value
- Non-controlling interests: equity interests of minority shareholders in companies controlled by the firm

### 2.8 Readings

#### 2.8.1 `Accounting_01_Introduction.pdf` (p. 1-15)

**Very important case study** in which the balance sheet is built with much more transactions as in the videos.

General notes:

- Managerial accounting vs financial accounting: first for inside firm, second for interested parties outside the company
- Annual report: summary of yearly financial status, public, audited, for for interested parties outside the company
- Balance sheet
  - Sources of capital (right)
    - Liabilties: `L`: current and non-current
    - Owners' equity: `OE`
  - Use of capital (left)
    - Assets: `A`: current and non-current
- Accounting idetity: `A = L + OE`
  - Or: `OE = A - L`: owned wealth is the residual after we substract to our resources the funds we need to return
  - `A - L = OE = NA`: aka net assets

**Case study:** DSJ company creation and operations over time (**very complete introductory example**):

- Usually, the balance sheet is presented every year or quarterly; therefore, we add an account in OE called **profit of the period**, which accounts for the revenues and expenses (i.e., profits).
- The balance sheet contains a summary of all transactions.
- When we pay the rent for a given time frame, this reduces the **cash** (assets), but it increases the account **prepaid rent** (assets), as the physical place is a resource we use!
- When we **sell** merchandise/goods, the revenues go to the account **profit of the period** (OE), and several things happen additionally:
  - If we sell merchandise/goods in cash, the received money goes to the cash account (assets).
  - If we sell on credit its value goes to an assets account called **accounts receivable** (in assets), not to the cash account; this way, it is clear we do not have the money yet.
  - Additionally we need to reflect the **costs of goods sold** (COGS) to keep a balance in the balance sheet: the **inventory** account (assets) needs to be decreased in the value of the associated cost and the **profit of the period** (OE) also decreased by the costs; this way, we have the real profits in the account **profit of the period**, not the revenue!
  - These steps are done often in separate entries because receiving the money and delivering the goods are separate events, and the amount of capital **in** the company is better portrayed that way.
- When we sell goods but we deliver them later, the revenues do not go to the **profits** account!
  - We register the increase in cash (assets).
  - We open/register the account **deposits from customers/unearned renevue** (liabilities).
- The contributed capital and the earned capital need to be well distinguished in the OE section.
- Expenses, if not tied to other assets, cause a decrease in two accounts
    1. **cash**
    2. **profit of the period**: here we usually add a note to the type of expense
- Updates of assets in the period:
  - Equipment: Depreciation of equipment is registered as an expense. Usually, the monthly fee is: `cost / useful life expentancy in months`; then we multiply it by the months in the period (usually 3 months, i.e., a quarter). Often the summary balance sheet contains an entry with the accumulated depreciation below the equipment cost value.
  - Prepaid rents: if we have a prepair rent for 6 months, this is reflected as an asset; however, after 3 months (period), its value has halved, and wee need to reflect it in two accounts
    1. prepaid rent (assets)
    2. profit
- Interests and Taxes to be payed
  - Even though interests and taxes can be required to be paid at year end, every period we need to account for them and change two accounts:
  1. **interests payable** / **taxes payable** (liabilities)
  2. profit (OE)
  - This is another example in which the recognition of an expense does not require cash outflow!

![DSJ Company: Transactions in first period of company since foundation](./pics/dsj_transactions.png)

Usually balance sheets are presented in two consecutive periods to analyze the development.

![DSJ Company: Balance sheet after the first period](./pics/dsj_balance_sheets.png)


#### 2.8.2 `Accounting_02_BalanceSheet.pdf`

All new concepts are integrated in the notes above.
The PDF provides three interesting real-life examples of balance sheets, each in one of the formats (Anglosaxon, European, UK):
- Walmart Stores
- Metro Group
- J Salisbury plc

Have a look at them!!

### 2.9 Balance Sheet: Summary of Accounts

See the collocated PDF

`Accounting_BalanceSheet_Accounts_Summary.pdf`

A very nice summary of most common accounts in each of the `A`, `L` and `OE` groups is provided.

### 2.10 Bookstore Case: Further Transactions in the Next (Second) Year

1. Purchase of books on credit for €130,000.
   - Accounts payable (L): +€130,000
   - Inventory (A): +€130,000
2. The Campus Bookstore sells books to individual customers who pay in cash. During x1, the total amount of cash sales is €120,000. The books sold in cash have a total purchase cost of €80,000.
   - Profit & Loss (OE) (Revenues - Expenses): +€120,000 (revenue) -80,000€ (expense)
   - Cash (A): +€120,000
   - Inventory (A): -80,000€
3. The Campus Bookstore sells books on credit to the school and other corporate customers. During x1, the total amount of credit sales is €60,000. The cost of the books sold on credit is €45,000.
   - Profit & Loss (OE): +€60,000 (revenue) -€45,000 
   - Accounts receivable (A): +€60,000
   - Inventory (A): -€45,000
   - **Important note**: **liquidity** and **profitability** are not the same! In this case, we have profitablity, but the profit is allocated in the account "Accounts Receivable", i.e., we don't have the money yet. Being liquid means we have cash we can use right away.
4. The Campus Bookstore pays €30,000 in cash for the selling, general and administrative costs incurred in x1. They include Cristina’s salary and utilities.
   - Profit & Loss (OE): -€30,000
   - Cash (A): -€30,000
   - Note that we don't use the "Salaries" account from Liabilities since the payment already took place; I understand that the "Salaries" refers more to payable salaries not paid yet...
5. In x1, the Campus Bookstore incurs in a rent expense of €6,000. This amount was already prepaid at the end of year x0.
   - The idea is we have an Asset account related to the prepaid rent; at the end of the year we need to decrease it; and we need to recognize we're poorer also
   - Prepaid rent (A): -6,000€
   - Profit & Loss (OE): -6,000€
6. On December 31st of x1, the Campus Bookstore prepays €6,600 for the rent of year x2.
   - Prepaid rent (A): +6,600€
   - Cash (A): -6,600€
7. The cash collected from credit sales is €38,000.
   - Cash (A): +€38,000
   - Accounts Receivable (A): -€38,000
   - Here we see that we are more liquid (because cash increased) but not more profitable, because the profits did not change!
8. The Campus Bookstore pays €10,000 to furniture and equipment suppliers, cancelling the pending obligation.
   - Cash (A): -€10,000
   - Accounts Payable, Others Payable (L): -€10,000
9. The Bookstore pays to the suppliers of the books the pending receipt of €125,000
   - Cash (A): -€125,000
   - Accounts Payable (L): -€125,000
10. The Campus Bookstore recognizes the depreciation of furniture and equipment in x1. The original purchase cost of furniture and equipment was €25,000. Cristina estimated a useful life of five years and no salvage value for this asset.
    - Accumulated Depreciation (below Furniture asset) (A): -((€25,000 original -0 salvage )/5 years) years of life = -€5,000
    - Profit & Loss (OE): -€5,000
      - Depreciation: for tangible non-current assets (always applied to NCA)
      - Amortization: for intangible non-current assets (always applied to NCA)
11. The Campus Bookstore recognizes the amortization of the software in x1. The original purchase cost of the software was €3,000. Cristina estimated a useful life of three years and no salvage value for this intangible asset.
    - Accumulated Amortization (A): - (3000 - 0) / 3 = -€1,000
    - Profit & Loss (OE): -€1,000
12.  At the end of x1, the Campus Bookstore recognizes and pays the interest cost on the bank loan. The bank charges an interest of 5% for the €20,000 loan, that is, €1,000.
    - Cash (A): - 0.05 * 20,000 = - €1,000
    - Profit & Loss: -€1,000 (interest expense)
    - Note that this transaction refers only to the interest; we are not returning principal, only paying the interest
13.  In x1, the Campus Bookstore makes a profit before taxes of €12,000 and recognizes corporate taxes of €3,600 (i.e. 30% x 12,000). This amount will be paid later in x2 when the tax forms are filed.
     - Taxes Payable (L): €3,600
     - Profit & Loss / Retained Profits (OE): -€3,600

#### Closing the year in the Belance Sheet

At the end of the year, we move the amount in the **Profit & Loss** (OE) account to the account **Retained Profits** (OE); if no such account exists, we open it.

- Profit & Loss (P/L) contains the profits of accumulated during the year and it is set to 0 at the end, to start the new year
- Retained Profits contains all profits accumulated during the existence of the company
- Having two different accounts makes possible to better evaluate the company: this year and its history.

![Balance Sheet: Status at End of Second Year](./pics/balance_sheet_second_year.png)

Interpretation of the Balance Sheet at the year end (always in comparison to previous year, compute percentage changes):
- We have enough cash + A/R (accounts receivable) to pay the current liabilities within a year.
- The bank loan is a future obligation, not for the short-term.
- Our non-current assets are decreasing due to depreciation/amortization, but we have still several years until the value is completely lost.
- The OE has increased: we increased the retained profits; however, our cash has decreased. Thus, we are more profitable, but less liquid.

**Important note: in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 there is a deeper interpretation guideline!**

#### My Notes

- **Liquidity and profitability** are decoupled:
  - Liquidity refers to Cash (A)
  - Profitability refers to Profit & Loss (OE)
  - We can sell goods on credit (Accounts Receivable): our profit increase, but not our cash, because we need to wait for the maturity of the delayed payment
- The account **Profit & Loss** from OE is very important: every time we are unsure, we ask whether *the owners got richer/poorer* and if there is a clear answer, we change the **Profit & Loss** account. **Revenues** and **Expenses** that modify the effective wealth of the owners go here!
  - Every time we have a **profit** or an **expense** which is not reflected in any other account to balance the counterpart entry, we need to add here the profit or expense line!
- **Depreciation and Amortization** apply always to Non-Current Assets
  - Depreciation is for tangible assets and Amortization for intangible ones
  - We need to define three components for the computation
    - Useful life of the asset, e.g. 5 years
    - Salvage value (value after useful life), e.g., 0
    - Method of depreciation, e.g. straight line (linear)
  - Computation (linear method): (acquisition value - salvage value) / years of useful life
  - And we modify two accounts
    - Accumulated Depreciation: right below the asset acquisition value which is depreciated
    - Profit & Loss: because we become poorer
  - We call the **net book value** of an asset its acquisition value minus the accumulated depreciation/amortization

### 2.11 Translation & Further Notes

I made this transactions into Spanish whilea skimming through the Spanish version of the Specialization, also available on Coursera.
There are also readings in Spanish:

#### `Contabilidad_01_Introduccion.pdf`

- Cash = caja
- Creditors = Acreedores: bancos, proveedores, etc.
- Share capital (EU) = Capital stock (USA) = capital social: capital put by founders or shareholders
- Balance sheet = balance de situación: financial state at a point in time
- Assets = Activo
- Liabilities = pasivo: funds we need to return
- Owners'/Shareholders' equity = patrimonio neto
- Equipment = inmobilizado material
- (Merchandise) inventory = Existencias
- Accounts payable = cuentas a pagar: when we get merchandise or similar on credit, i.e., we have not payed yet, but we need to pay it gradully in time
- Gross profit = beneficio bruto
- Profits/Earnings = renevues - expenses

## 3. The Income Statement

### 3.1 Example with the Bookstore Case

This section continues with the state of the balance sheet after the second year (see Section 2.10).

![Balance Sheet: Status at End of Second Year](./pics/balance_sheet_second_year.png)

The most important accounts for the shareholders are two: 
- Cash: it's related to the liquidity the company has
- Profit & Loss (or Retained Profits, when closing the year): it's related to the profitability of the company

Recall that these two accounts are not necessarily coupled!

Due to their importance, each of these accounts has its own financial statement:
- The Cashflow statement (analyzed in later sections)
- The Income Statement of the Statement of Profit and Loss

The **income statement** gives an overview of how we are incrementing the OE with the operations of the company.
To prepare the **income statement** all **revenues** and **expenses** during the year are listed and grouped in categories.

![P & L account for the income statement](./pics/pl_income_statement.png)

- Sum of all sales
- Sum of the Costs of Goods Sold: COGS
- Sum of all other expenses: Selling and General Admin expenses: SG&A (salaries, utilities, rent, etc.)
- Sum of all depreciation and amortization expenses
- Sum of all financial expenses (bank loan interests, etc.)
- Sum of all taxes

Then, we compute
- Gross margin = Sales - COGS; we can compare it to other competitors
- EBITDA = Gross margin - SG&A (Earnings before interest and taxes depreciation and amortization)
- EBIT = Operating Profit = EBITDA - Depreciation & Amortization (Earnings before interest and taxes)
- Profit before taxes = EBIT - financial/interest expenses
- Net profit = Profit before taxes - Taxes

![Bookstore: Income Statement](./pics/bookstore_income_statement.png)

After computing the income statement, we compute some ratios in orther to evaluate the operations:

- Return on sales = Net Profit / Sales: 8,400 / 180,000 = 4.7%
- Return on Equity = Net Profit / OE: 8,400 / 50,000 = 16.8%
  - The profit as the percentage of the investment
  - An alternative is to use the average OE during the year in the denominator.

We need to compare those ratios to previous years and other similar companies!

### 3.2 Readings: Notes

#### `Accounting_01_Introduction.pdf` (p. 11-15)

At the end of the fiscal year/period , the amount in the OE account **profit & losses (of the period)** (P/L) is transferred to the OE account **retained profits**, which contains all retained profits during the company's history.
P/L is a very important account, since it summarizes how well the company did in the period! Since it is very important, a new table/statement is created for it: **The Income Statement** or **Profit & Loss account (P & L)**. This table is basically the list of all transactions (or groups of transactions) in the account **profit of the period**. The order matters: revenues are decreased from most basic expenses to taxes until we get the net profit:

1. **Sales revenue**: everything we have earned
2. **Gross profit** = sales revenue - COGS expenses
3. **Operating profit** = Gross profit - operation expenses
   - Operation expenses: salaries, depreciation, rent, etc.
4. **Profit before income tax** = Operating profit - interest expenses
5. **Net profit** = Profit before income tax - income tax
   - Income tax (= impuesto de sociedades) is applied on the profits after all expenses except the taxes; it is different for each countries, and it varies depending on the size and activities of the company

Note that the shareholders can obtain **dividends** from the **net profit**.
Since the dividends are not an expense, they do not appear in the income statement; however, they are reflected in the balance sheet, because they are part of the financial image of the company: **Cash** (assets) and **Profit of the period / Retained profit** are decreased with the amount payed in dividends.

That explains why **profit of the period** is renamed to **retained profits** in the income statement: the income statement accounts for the profits generated (revenues - expenses), independently of how they are distributed.

![DSJ Company: Income statement after the first period](./pics/dsj_income_statement.png)

How a basic financial analysis is done:
- Check **balance sheet**
  - How big is the net profit?
  - How are `A`, `L` and `OE` distributed?
  - Do current assets pay the current liabilities?
    - If our cash is able to pay all current liabilities, that's perfect; but not necessary
    - Same question is applied to non-current assets vs liabilities
- Check the **income statement**
  - How was the net profit obtained?
  - `Profit margin = Net profit / Sales`: how big is it?
  - `Return on equity (ROE) = Net profit / OE`: how big is it? (4x for annualized return)


#### `Accounting_03_IncomeStatement.pdf`

- The income statement relates to a period of time (often a year).
- Note that **revenues are not cash inflows** and **expenses are not cash outflows**; therefore, the net frofit obtained in the income statement is not the change in cash in the period analyzed.
  - The reason is that transactions such as sales on credit are considered assets, even though there is no cash involved.
- Operation expenses are separated because operations could change more rapidly than the costs related to goods sold

##### Classification of Expenses

See tables below.

Two ways of reporting expenses:

1. By the Function related to the expenses
   - Gross profit is computed
   - Common in Anglo-Saxon countries; companies are switching to this format because the gross profit is computed
   - Note that salaries, utilities, materials, etc. are note reported separately; instead, the proportions of them are alloccated to the different functions.

2. By the Nature of the expenses
   - Gross profit is not computed
   - Here, for instance, we cannot tell how much material costs are due to production, research, administration, etc.
   - The same applied to salaries
   - More common in continental Europe


![Income Statement: Expenses by Function](./pics/income_statement_expenses_function.png)

![Income Statement: Expenses by Function](./pics/income_statement_expenses_nature.png)

##### Recognition of Revenues and Expenses

Not anything can appear as revenue or expense in the income statement.

- Revenues are recognized if
  - the company has delivered the goods/services promised
  - the company has received cash or some other convertible to cash
- Expenses are recognized if either of these happens:
  - The consumption of an asset (expense) matches with a revenue obtained from that consumption (= matching principle)
  - The consumption of an asset (expense) results from the passage of time (depreciation, interest)

##### Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)

The non-recognizes revenues and expenses that arise from changes in value of assets (not from transactions) are included in an OE account called **accumulated other comprehensive income**. Examples of items include: benefits from pensions, currency translations, derivatives, etc.

That account might be appended explicitly to the net income at the end; in other cases, another separate statement is done, called **statement of comprehensive income**.

##### Earnings per Share (EPS)

At the end, the net profit is divided by the number of shares -- very important indicator.
Note that:
- A weighted average might be used to compute the number of shares, because the real number might vary in the period if more are issued
- Two ways of reporting: basic and diluted; diluted refers to the effects due to the conversion to shares of some financial instruments, such as stock options.

##### Examples of Income Statements

- The Linde Group
- Air Liquide
- Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

## 4. The Cash Flow Statement

### 4.1 T-Accounts and Journal Entries

T-Accounts are a simple way of recording and accumulating the transactions in an account in an orderly manner. They have two sides, one for the increases in the account, the other for the decreases in the account. Each account, no matter in which group (`A`, `L`, `OE`), has its own T-account.

Always, no matter `A`, `L`, `OE`:
- Left side is Debit = Dr. (Debere)
- Right side is Credit = Cr. (Credere)

**Do not try to look into meannings of Debit and Credit: it is just left and right!**

Now, for assets `A`:
- Increases are on the left, Debit
- Decreases are on the right, Credit

For liabilities `L` & owners' equity `OE`, it is the other way around:
- Increases are on the right, Credit
- Decreases are on the left, Debit

![T-Accounts: main idea and how they work](./pics/t_accounts_idea.png)

Then, the idea is that we register any transaction on the correct side of each account. At the end of the year we sum both sides, apply the rest between the column/side totals, and we have the ending balance of each account!

However, instead of working on the T-accounts, the accountant uses **journal entries**: every transaction is registered in a journal, specifying: accounts involved and the ammounts increased/decreased on their Debit/Credit side. Basaically, the journal entry is done and the software updates the T-accounts!

![Journal entries: example](./pics/journal_entry_example.png)

The T-accounts are called the **ledger**. Now, we know all the elements of the accounting process:
- Record: with journal entries
- Classify: with T-Accounts, that consitute the ledger 
- Summarize: with financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement)

![Accounting process: summary](./pics/accounting_process_summary.png)

### 4.2 Campus Bookstore Example: New Transactions Registered in T-Accounts & Balance Sheet

The transactions for period x2 (also available in PDF form: `./Acccounting_Transactions-Week-3.pdf`) are listed below. Relevant comments are done below each transaction. After the list, an image is added with the transactions allocated to T-accounts.

1. Purchase of books on credit for €150,000.
2. The cash sales of books are €140,000. The cost of books sold in cash is €98,000.
3. Sales on credit amount to €70,000. The cost of books sold on credit is €50,000.
4. Collections from credit sales to customers are €64,000.
5. Payments to suppliers of books are €155,000.
6. Selling, general and administrative costs amount to €37,000, all paid in cash.
7. The Campus Bookstore recognizes the rent expense of €6,600. This amount was prepaid at the end of x1.
8. On December 31st x2, the Campus Bookstore pays €7,200 in advance for the full rent of year x3.

   - Recall that prepaid rents are an asset: we pay for using a good over a period of time!

9.  Cristina has estimated a depreciation expense of €5,000 for furniture and equipment in x2.

    - Recall depreciation (tangigle assets) and amortization (intangible assets) is registered in separate accounts to the asset purcha value to better track the value evolution.
    - Since amprtization and depreciaton are considered assets accounts that reduce asset value, they sit on the credit (right) side; that is why they are called *contra assets*.

10. The estimated amortization of software is €1,000.
11. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore sells the furniture and equipment for a price of €1,800 in cash. The original cost of the furniture and equipment sold was €5,000 and the accumulated depreciation €2,000.

    -  When a depreciating asset is sold, we need to consider:
       -  Asset/equipment purchase price (asset account)
       -  Its accumulated depreciation at sold time (depreciation account)
       -  Selling price (cash account), which might be different to the purchase - depreciation value, incurring in possible gains or losses (P & L account)
    -  It is common to sell equipment when we want to buy newer one!

12. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore purchases new furniture and equipment for €6,000 in cash.
13. On December 31st, Cristina decides to invest in Apple shares for a total amount of €15,000.
    
    - Buying stocks opens a new current asset account: **Marketable securities**.
    - It is important to account for the value change of these assets; more on that later in the course.

14. The interest recognized and paid on the bank loan at the end of x2 is €1,000.
15. In x3, the Campus Bookstore will have to repay the principal of the loan. So it reclassifies the €20,000 from the long-term bank loan account to another account in current liabilities.

    - The bank loan was for 3 years, but 2 years have passed, thus, we need to re-classify it as a current lianility
    - Re-classification occurs by closing the old account (Bank loan, debit total: 20k) and opening a new with the amount to be paid: Bank loan current, credit total: 20k.

16. On December 31st x2, the Campus Bookstore receives a new long-term bank loan for €30,000

    - It is common to ask for loans if we want to expand our business: we need financing!

17. Taxes paid are €3,600.
18. The tax expense recognized at the end of x2 is €3,060.

    - Taxes or expenses we will have in the future are registered immediately in accounting
    - Thus, we open (1) a tax/expense payable liability account crediting it and the P & L account is debited immediately also, because we anticipate we're going to be poorer.
    - Later, when we pay the expense/taxes, the cash and expense/tax payable accounts are registered

19. The Campus Bookstore makes the closing entry. The net profit for the year is €7,140

    - Sum the **P & L account**: the total of period x2
    - Debit the **P & L account** with the total P/L of x2 and credit the **Retained profits** account
    - Now, **P & L account** has a **End Balance (EB)** of 0, and the gains are registered together with the accumulated wealth.

20. Cristina and her uncle decide to pay themselves cash dividends of €10,000.

    - Dividends are paid from the **Retained profits**, they're not related to the **P & L account**!
    - Therefore, we credit the Cash account and debit the Retained profits account
    - That means two things
      - We need to have cash to pay them
      - We might pay them even tough we have no profits for the year if we have enough accuulated profits in the past years
    - Dividend payment is usually approved by teh shareholders.

In the following, the transactions allocated to the T-accounts are shown. Each transaction has an identifiable number that matches with the transaction list above. Notes: 

- The first line contains only one side with the **Beginning Balance (BB)**.
- If there is no BB, a `-` is put.
- Left (debit) and right (credit) columns do not need to be related!
- The **Ending Balance (EB)** (of the period) is the sum and difference of both sides of the columns

![Bookstore transactions for the period x2: T-accounts](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x2_t_accounts.png)

In the following, the balance sheet of the company at the year end is provided. Recall:
- Assets are ordered from most liquid to least
- Liabilities are ordered from sonnest maturity to latest

As a general interpretation, we see that:
- Current assets (in particular, cash and marketable securities) can pay current liabilities.
- `OE` and `NCL` can replace `NCA`.

![Bookstore transactions for the period x2: Balance Sheet](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x2_balance_sheet.png)


**Important note: in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 there is a deeper interpretation guideline!**

### 4.3 Campus Bookstore Example: Income Statement

For the preparation of the Income Statement, all the transactions of the **P & L account** are listed in an analytical way.

![Bookstore transactions for the period x2: Income Statement](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x2_income_statement.png)

Two important indicator must be computed every time (and we need to track them over time), and both are related to the most important value in the income statement, i.e., **the net profit**:

- Return on Sales = `Net Profit` / `Sales`: 3.4% (less than last year)
- Return on Equity = `Net Profit` / `OE`: 12.2% (less than last year)

### 4.4 Campus Bookstore Example: The Cash Flow Statement

Profit if not the same as the change in cash, because cash in/outflows do not match with revenues/expenses. Example transactions that show that:

- We can sell/buy on credit.
- Depreciation does not involve any cash, but it is an expense.

As the income statement focusses on the **Profit and loss account**, the **Cash Flow** focusses on the **Cash account**. The Cash Flow account shows the **capability of the company to generate cash and repay its debt**.

In the **Cash Flow** statement, all cash in and outflows, i.e., all entries from tha Cash T-account, are classified in the three stages of a business cycle: **financing, investing, operations**. Note:

- Cash inflows are on the left (debit) of the cash account, outflows on the right (credit).
- We are interested in the change of cash, thus the begining balance is not considered.
- Cash flow from operations (CFO): all transactions related to the activities related to the revenue creation; as a rule off thumb: cash entries reflected in the P&L account; also interests.
- Cash flow from investing (CFI): entries related to non-current assets, marketable securities, etc.
- Cash flow from financing (CFF): loans, dividends, etc.

Sometimes, it is not that clear where each entry goes, it is more convention-based. However, this formula always holds, obviously:

`Change in Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF`

![Bookstore transactions for the period x2: Cash Flow Statement](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x2_cash_flow.png)

#### 4.4.1 Interpretation of the Cash Flow and the Income Statement: Profitability & Liquidity

Regarding the picture above:

- CFO is small not enough to finance investments; that is because we have on credit sales that have not produced cash inflow yet
- The CFI is very negative; however, that is in part because of the non-necessary Apple stock investment, which could become an inflow very fast
- The CFF is quite high; that is usual when starting a business or when expanding: we need inflow from financing
- We have a small total increase in cash (1k), much smaller than the profit (7k)
  - An explanation is that sales are higher than collections, due to on credit sales; we would need to check the accounts receivable from the balance sheet
  - The payments to suppliers are higher than the cost of goods sold; are we buying too much inventory? are we paying too soon to the suppliers?

![Bookstore transactions for the period x2: Interpretation of the Cash Flow Statement and the Income Statement](./pics/bookstore_x2_interpretation_cf_is.png)

**Important note: in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 there is a deeper interpretation guideline!**

#### 4.4.2 Direct and Indirect Methods for the Computation of the Cash Flow

The used method is the **direct method**: we take the **cash account** and classify the in/outflows of entries.

There is another method: **the indirect method**. CFI and CFF are computed the same way, but it CFO is computed differently: the net profit is reconciled with the operations. See the reading for more info.

### 4.5 Readnigs: Notes

#### 4.5.1 `Accounting_01_Introduction.pdf` (p. 14 - end)

**The Statement of Cash Flows**

Profits and cash are decoupled because not all revenues are cash inflows (e.g. sales on credit) and not all expenses are cash outflows (e.g., acquisitions payable). That is the effect of the **the Accrual Basis of Accounting (= principio de devengo)**: the economic impact of events and transactions is recognized when they occur, not when cash is exchanged!

However, the amount of cash, and thus, the evolution of it, is extremely important for the good operation of the comany; many firms fail because of shortages or bad management of cash.

Therefore, in addition to the income statement, we need another statement to show the evolution of the cash flows during the period: that is the **Cash Flows Statement** -- in it, the cash generation and consumption for the period is summarized.

The Cash Flows statement can be done in to ways that provide the same result:

1. Direct method: all entries of the Cash account (`A`) are listed in three groups or stages of the business cycle
2. Indirect method: done when there is no access to the Cash account

The Cash Flows Statement with the direct method, three groups of entries in the Cash (`A`) account:

1. Cash from financing activities (= actividades de financiación)
   - Capital contributions by owners (+)
   - Borrowings (+)
   - Repayments of borrowings (-)
   - Payment of dividends (-)
2. Cash from investments activities (= actividades de inversión)
   - Purchases of properties, equipement, etc. (-)
   - Purchases of financial assets (-)
3. Cash from operations activities (= actividades de explotación): Rest
   - Collections from customers (+)
   - Payments to suppliers and employees (salaries) (-)
   - Payments of taxes (-)
   - Payments of operating expenses (rent, insurance, utilities, etc.) (-)
   - Interests (+/-)
   - Collection of dividends (+)


![The Statement of Cash Flows: DSJ Example](./pics/cash_flows_statement_dsj.png)

**Accounting Records, T-Accounts and Journal Entries**

Instead of keeping a large table with rows as accounts, usually each account has its own table which is shaped in two columns, with a T-shaped form. Columns are:

- Debit = Debere = Dr. = "to owe" = "deber"; on the **left**
- Credit = Credere =  Cr. = "to entrust" = "haber"; on the **right**

Note:
- "Deber" does not mean the company ows something!
- "Haber" does not mean the company has something!
- "Cargar": when entry in debit ("deber") done
- "Abonar": when entry in credit ("haber") done

Asset accounts:
- Increases in the account are recorded on the left = Increase Debit: +
- Decreses in the account on the right = Decrease Credit: -

Liability and Owners' Equity accounts: the opposite:
- Increases in the account are recorded on the right = Increase Credit: +
- Decreses in the account on the left = Decrease Debit: -

Note that
- Debits increase asset accounts, but decrease liability and OE accounts
- Credits decrease asset accounts, but increase liability and OE accounts

Note also:

![T-Accounting: Main Idea](./pics/t_accounts_main.png)

Example: we get a loan of 10€, which increases or Cash account (Asset) begining balance (BB) of 12€ to have and ending balance (EB) of 22€; in parallel, the Loan account (Liability) is also modified:

![T-Accounting: Simple example](./pics/t_accounts_simple_example.png)

A very complete example is provided for the DSJ company:

![T-Accounting: DSJ complete example](./pics/t_accounts_dsj_example.png)

Accounting is done in practice using a journal: **journal entries** are done for each transaction, consisting each entry of 2 or more changes in the debit/credit of 2 or more accounts. The software takes each entry and creates the T-accounts from those entries automatically. Thus: **accounting is simplified to doing correct journal entries, the rest is automatic**.

![Journal entries](./pics/accounting_jorunal_entries.png)

##### My Notes

- CFO is related to the cash due to the real business
- CFI is related to any investments we do to carry out our business: equipment & Co.
- CFO is related to the loans & Co. we receive or need to repay

Thus, a start-up, in ints first years is expected to have

CFO < 0, CFI < 0, CFO > 0

In this manner, we can interpret in which stage a company is (re-starting, consolidated, expanding, etc.), depending on their CF groups.

**Important note: in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 there is a deeper interpretation guideline!**

##### Translation

- Cash flow statement = estado de flujos de efectivo
- Cash from financing activities = efectivo de actividades de financiación
- Cash from operations activities = efectivo de actividades de explotación
- The Accrual Basis of Accounting = principio de devengo
- T-accounting = cuentas en T
- Journal entries = asientos contables

#### 4.5.2 `Accounting_04_CashFlowStatement.pdf`

The cash account is essential for the good functioning of the company: if we run out of cash we cannot pay our immediate expenses and we cannot finance our operations; thus, we company would collapse. The Cash flow statement summarizes the management of the cash account.

##### Cash Flow Statement with the Indirect Method

If we have access to the cash account, the direct method is used, classifying each in/outflow of cash in one of the 3 stages of the business cycle: operations, financing, investing.

However, when we don't have complete access to the cash account, the indirect method can be used for the **operations** stage. The idea is to *reconcile net income to cash from operations*; the cash flow of financing and investing is the same.

Note that the indirect method seems quite confusing; however, it is the method required by the authorities, thus, often we get the *direct* method and a section with the *reconciliation of net income to the cash flow from operating activities*. That reconciliation or adjustement is due to the fact that the net income is the difference between revenues and expenses, being revenues and expenes not always cash transactions.

The computation is derived from the accounting equality:

`A = L + OE`

`Cash + A* = L + OE`, with `A*` = assets other than cash

`d(Cash) = -d(A*) + d(L) + d(OE)`: `d()` = difference from start to end or year-to-year.

Thus, applying that to the operations stage, we have:

**CFO** = Cash Flows due to Operations =  

`+` Net income
`+` Depreciation
`+` Non-operating losses
`-` Non-operating gains
`-` Operating assets other than cash
`+` Operating liabilities

It is also possible to further differentiate the operating assets and liabilities as current and non-current, in such a way that we introduce the change or the **working capital** (CA - CL):

...
`-` Non-operating gains
`-` Operating non-current assets other than cash
`+` Operating non-current liabilities
`-` d(WC = Operating current assets other than cash - Operating current liabilities)

Using either method for the CFO computation (direct or indirect), we shouldd obtain the same result.

In the reading, severa very thorough examples are provided.

Finally, some companies report the **free cash flow**, which is the measure of the firm's ability to generate cash necessary to maintain operations:

`Free cash flow = CFO - Capex`

`Capex` are the capital expenditures: net cash investments in property, plant and equipment; in the example shown, it equals to the CFF.

##### Translation

- Working capital = capital circulante
- Cash flow = flujos de efectivo
- Free cash flow = caja libre
- Reconciliation = conciliación

## 5. Accrual Accounting

### 5.1 Accrual Accounting vs. Cash Accounting

Profitability and Liquidity are related, bu they are not the same; that is because we do accrual accounting. Recall:

- Profit = Revenues - Expenses
- Change in cash = Cash inflows - Cash outflows

Not all revenues and expenses have their equivalent (instant) cash inflows and outflows, because, for instance:

- We might buy/sell on credit, so we have revenues/expenses, but cash transactions happen later in time
- Depreciation/amortization are expenses that don't affect cash

In other words, **accrual accounting** recognizes revenues and expenses when they occur, independently of any cash flows that might happen or not. Thus, for instance, a credit sale is recognized when the product is delivered, not when the associated cash is received!

The counterpart method would be **cash accounting**, which is not used in practice: it recognizes only cash payments and receipts. That method would be able to provide only the cash flow statement, missing the balance sheet and the income statement. That would have the following shortcomings:

- We'd have missing assets purchased on credit (e.g., inventories): even though we'd have not paid them, we'd own them!
- Missing payment obligations (e.g., Accounts payable)
- Missing sales and expenses on credit
- Any economic event that does not affect the cash account is missing! Including: assets acquired in previous years (e.g., equipment)!
- The profit would be only the cash profit, which is not true!

### 5.2 Measuring Performance with Accrual Accounting

Although profitability and liquidity are not the same, they are related. Such is the case, that if we stop activities and let time pass until all pending transactions close, profits and cash are the same. In other words, profits and cash are different due to the missmatch in time of cash transactions.

If only the cash account is used to evaluate the performance of the company, we get a biased view of what is happening:

- One year we might have less cash because we invest to have future revenues, and it seems to be bad, even though it is not! In fact, companies would not buy anything (not even equipment), because it would have a negative impact on the cash account -- so nothing would work.
- Another year we might sell assets and we get more cash, but this might be bad, since we have no means to generate profits the coming year.

Accrual accounting is a less biased way of evaluating the performance of a company; there are much less fluctuations and the real generated revenues are taken into account. That is a much better information for shareholders.

One disadvantage of accrual accounting: we need to do estimations (e.g., for depreciation); that is subject to errors or manipulations. In other words, in contrast to cash accounting, accrual accounting yields estimations.

### 5.3 Bookstore Case: New Transactions

Examples related to accrual accounting.

1. Prepaid insurance

   -  The Campus Bookstore prepays €1,200 on April 1st x3 for a full year of insurance.
   -  By December 31st, the Campus Bookstore recognizes the consumption of €900 of insurance (i.e. use of 9 out of 12 months). We have insurance for 3 months more, but we need to recognize the spent 9 months.

![Bookstore example: accrual accounting - prepaid insurance](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x3_accrual_insurance.png)

2. Interest on bank loan

   -  The Campus Bookstore received a €10,000 bank loan on July 1st x3 to be repaid at the end of three years.
   -  The 5% interest cost of the loan has to be paid every Jun 30th.
   -  However, since we prepare the balance sheet for the year end, we need to recognize the interest of the passed 6 months: 5% of 10,000€ x 0.5 = 250€

![Bookstore example: accrual accounting - loan interest before due date](./pics/bookstore_transactions_x3_accrual_interest.png)

3. Advances from customers (i.e. unearned revenues)

   - On March 31st, the Campus Bookstore receives an order of books for €10,000 from a corporate customer that pays €6,000 in advance. Note that orders are not recognized in accounting; however, it is often requested to keep an **order backlog** that shows the orders in the pipeline. As investors, we need to ask that. However, advances from customers are recognized in accounts under names similar to "advances from customers" or "unearned revenues".
   - The order of books is delivered to the customer on May 31st.
   - The remaining €4,000 owed by the customers are received on Jun 30th.

### 5.4 Performance Evolution of the Campus Bookstore

Usually companies publish the financial statements of consecutive periods (years) to make interpretations easier. In fact, the balance sheet is a picture in time, a position, so it needs some comparative values to be interpreted correctly.

In the following, the two consecutive periods x1 and x2 are compared.
#### 5.4.1 Balance Sheet

The bookstore blance sheet for periods x1 and x2:

![Balance Sheet in Two Periods: Performance evaluation](./pics/bookstore_x3_performance_balance_sheet.png)

We need to pose questions for all the accounts in the B/S:

- Inventory: it has increased; do we need that much inventory? how long does it take to sell them? is there some seasonality in the business?
  - Days of sales in inventory = Inventory / (COGS / 365 days)
  - x1: 131 days
  - x2: 116 days: we sell faster on average, it seems well managed
- Seasonality: when seasonality is considerable, numbers fluctuate a lot and the picture might be different every time we take it. Consider important time points: Christmas, etc.
- Accounts Receivable (A/R): the amount has increased; do we have problems collecting? do we have more corporate customers? is it because growth in sales?
  - Days of sales in A/R = A/R / (Sales / 365 days)
  - x1: 45 days
  - x2: 49 days; that is the average time that takes the customers to pay us.
- Cash has increased, that is good.
  - In general, we can see there's a cash cycle: Cash -> Purchases of Inventory -> Inventories Sold -> A/R increase -> A/R become cash -> repeat
  - However, there is a missmatch in time, so liquidity and profitability are not the same!
- NCA: small value; typical for companies which rent, do not invest in properties.
- Software amortization: only one year of software left; ask for plans to extend it.
- Accounts Payable (A/P): it has decreased; can we delay the payments? is the level reasonable?
  - Days of COGS in A/P = A/P / (COGS / 365 days)
  - x1: 131 days
  - x2: 99 days; we pay on average 99 days later
- CA vs CL: we check tthat the Current Assets can pay all Current Liabilities; in fact, cash and the marketable securities (Apple stocks) alone cover the CL.
- NCA, NCL, OE: do we have long-term resources (OE, that we don't need to return and long-term loans in NCL) to cover the long-term investments (NCA)? Yes, we do.

#### 5.4.2 Income Statement

The bookstore income statement for periods x1 and x2:

![Income Statement in Two Periods: Performance evaluation](./pics/bookstore_x3_performance_income_statement.png)

Look at these points and ask these questions (to the managers):
- Sales and Net Profit: the most important ones; then, we continue downwards with the remaning items on the income statement
  - Compute percentages of increase/decrease
  - Sales have increased, but net profit has decreased
  - Sales or Revenues: why have they increased?
    - Higher prices? Higher qunatities?
    - New products? New customers?
    - Differentiation? Low-cost?
    - ...
- Gross Margin: compute percetange Gross Margin / Sales: it has decreased slightly
  - Higher purchase cost? No discounts?
  - Different product mix? Higher % of low margin products?
  - Lower selling price?
  - Lower productivity? (specially for manufacturing firms)
  - ...
- Operating Profit: compute percentage Operating Profit / Sales: it has decreased
  - Do we have one-time or recurring expenses?
  - Operating leverage: which are the fixed vs. variable costs?
  - Was there inflation in the SG&A? On which items?
  - ...
- Profit Before Taxes: compute percentage Profit Before Taxes / Sales: it has decreased
  - Do we have more debt (loans, etc. - check the B/S)
  - Is the cost of the debt higher?
  - ...
- Net Profit: Net Profit / Sales: it has decreased
  - Compute
    - Return on Sales = Net Profit / Sales: it has decreased
    - Return on Equity = Net Profit / OE: it has decreased

#### 5.4.3 Cash Flow Statement

The bookstore cash flow statement for periods x1 and x2:

![Cash Flow Statement in Two Periods: Performance evaluation](./pics/bookstore_x3_performance_cash_flow.png)

Look at these points and ask these questions (to the managers):
- Change in Cash: CFO + CFI + CFF: it has increased
  - CFO: it has increased considerably; operations are the real activities of the company: selling products
    - Note that in x1 we were more profitable, but CFO was negative: that is because cash had not begun to completely inflow to company
    - In x2 we are not as profitable, but CFO, i.e., cash from operations, or in other words, cash from customers is positive, because cash has started to pour in.
    - The major reason why CFO is positive now is that we have more sales, which turn into cash inflows
  - CFI: negative in both years, more negative in x2
    - This is normal in companies which are starting, due to investments in equipment, furniture, etc.
    - Also, note that part of the negative amount is related to the acquisition of the Apple stock; that could be sold at any moment, therefore, we should not worry so much about its high negative amount.
- The most important reading is to check that we have plenty of cash, which covers the most important part of the current liabilities.

## 5.5 Reading and Interpreting Real Financial Statements: Inditex Case

Statements obtained from the website.
Note that since Inditex (Zara & Co.) is dedicated to manufacturing and selling clothes, they have a seasonality effect around Christmas. Therefore, their year closing is defined on the 31st of January; on that date, we expect to have more cash and less inventories. Additionally, note that two consecutive period results are reported always, for better interpretation.

### 5.5.1 Balance Sheet

![Inditex: Balance Sheet](./pics/inditex_balance_sheet.png)

![Inditex: Balance Sheet](./pics/inditex_balance_sheet_web.png)

- Property, plant, equipment has increased: investing in new stores; the own them.
  - But they also rent: leased assets.
- Inventories: there is an increase; we should compute days to sell inventories
  - Days to sell in 2013: Inventories 2013 / (COGS 2013 / 365) = 90 days
  - Days to sell in 2014: Inventories 2014 / (COGS 2014/ 365) = 90 days
  - Same number of days even though inventories increased, so it's OK
  - We should always consider if the business is seasonal; in this case it is. Seasonality affects to cash and inventories!
  - Inditex is known to be very good at managing inventories.
- Cash: there is a large amount; normal, because the closure is after Christmas and providers are to be paid (Trade and other payables).
  - Analyze cash evolution in the Cash Flow Statement
- Equity is increased 
  - The amount is: Previous + Profit - Dividends
- Liabilities
  - With so much generation of cash, the company doesn't need loans to operate
  - However, Accounts payable (A/P) is considerable: we compute the days used to repay
    - Days in 2013 = A/P 2013 / (COGS / 365) = 179 days
    - Days in 2014 = A/P 2014 / (COGS / 365) = 170 days
    - They pay very late to the suppliers; it's normal that they generate so much cash
- Look at the asset Goodwill: it can/should refer to a brand
  - However, to be an asset, that brand must have been acquired by Inditex.
  - Since Zara was internally created, that entry must refer to another brand purchased by Inditex, for instance Massimo Dutti.
### 5.5.2 Cash Flow (CF) Statement

![Inditex: Cash Flow Statement](./pics/inditex_cash_flow_statement_web.png)

- Inditex offers the CF from operations (CFO) using the indirect methods; we don't need to go into detail, we can jump to the CFO result.
  - CFO is huge: it is bigger than the profit of the company!
  - That happens when the company is growing sales; also the goods are bought on credit or suppliers paid later
- What is done with that cash flow from operations? Look at themost important entries in CF Investing & CF Financial Activities (i.e., the entries with largest amounts)
  - CF Investments (CFI): Properties are being bought in a large amount: the company is expanding
  - CF Financial Activities (CFF): Dividend payments to shareholders are quite notable
### 5.5.3 Income Statement

![Inditex: Cash Flow Statement](./pics/inditex_income_statement_web.png)

- Compute percentages of the Net sales of each entry/line
- Always look and monitor the **Gross Profit**: compare it to previous years and competitors
  - Gross Profit (GP) = Net Sales - Cost of Sales (all manufacturing costs)
  - 2013: GP / Sales = 59.3%
  - 2014: GP / Sales = 58.3%
  - There is 1% drop: why is that? it seems to be low, but it is to consider. Ask the managers:
    - Lower selling prices?
    - Inflation by manufacturing costs?
    - Lower productivity?
    - Different product mix?
- Operating expenses: marketing, non-manufacturing salaries (design, sales, etc.), headquarters, etc.
- Financial expenses: low and positive; normal, since they don't have many financial debt because of the large amount of cash generation
- Net income
  - Return on Sales 2014 = Net Income 2014 / Net Sales 2014 = 13.9%
  - Return on Equity 2014 = Net Income 2014 / Equity 2014 = 27%: very high

## 6. More Advanced Topics to Research on Our Own

- Cost of goods sold: since we buy inventories along the time, their price changes, so it is not that straightforward to measure the cost of the goods sold; some techniques
  - FIFO
  - LIFO
  - Weighted average cost
- Manufacturing companies have production costs associated to the sod goods - which costs are included in the costs of goods sold?
- Inventories loose value along time: how do we account for that? Inventory valuation
- Credit sales: what happens if a customer doesn't pay? These are bad debts, and we know that there is going to be a percentage that occurs regularly. Banks have so called bad loans: loans that are not paid back.
- Sales returns: how do we account for that?
  - Because customers are not satisfied
  - Warranty
- Financial assets: if we buy stocks and the price fluctuates, how do we account for it?
- Loss of value of assets (e.g., computer breaks): these are impairments of non-current assets
- Long-term debt: bonds. Companies take their long-term debt, fraction it and sell it to the market; these are called bonds. How do we account for it?
- Leases, capital or operating: how do we account for them?
- Owner's Equity: many more transactions can happen beyond P/L and dividends, such as capital issues, repurchase of shares, etc.
- Corporate taxes: taxable profits are not as straightforward as we have seen; they often must need to be adjusted.

## 7. Final Assignment

There is a companion PDF with the financial statements of Fibertech (same as in the final quiz). We need to answer the following 2 questions, providing at least 4 items for each, supported with facts/calculations. Each item is worth 1 point. 75% must be covered.

I meade all the computations on the companion PDF:

`./Week-4-Assignment-Material.pdf`

Example of comment: Profitability: *Fibertech is very profitable. The net profit is XYZ. The return on sales is X% (i.e. Net profit / Sales = XYZ/ ABC). The return on equity is XX% (i.e. Net profit / Average owner's equity for the year = XYZ / [(XXX + YYY)/2] = XX%).*

### Submission

> Project Title

Financial Analysis of Fibertech GmbH for the period x4

> Q1. Briefly discuss Fibertech’s financial statements. Please comment on its financial position, profitability, liquidity and whatever relevant information you can interpret from the financial statements. (5 items are possible in the solution, at least 4 must be discussed)

(Note: for the sake of clarity, money amounts are written in multipes of €1,000)

Fibertech is very profitable. The net profit for the period x4 is 336. The return on sales is 15.2% (i.e. Net profit / Sales = 336 / 2,100). The return on equity is 75.8% (i.e. 336 / Average owner's equity for the year = 443 [(290 + 596)/2]).

The liquidity (cash balance) of the company has decreased 29.7% (i.e., 1 - 239/340), compared with period x3. Cash is able to cover only 53.7% of current liabilities (i.e., 239/445), however all the current assets are able to cover a wide 246.1% (i.e., 1,095/445) of all current liabilities. Thus, even though the cash situation should be improved, the current liabilities seem to be safely covered.

Inventories have increased 40% (i.e., 350/250 - 1) compared to the previous period x3. The days of sales in inventory is in x4 91.3 days (i.e., 350 / (COGS/365 = 1,400/365)); that means the company could sell all the inventory in approximately 3 months (using the average annual rate). That amount of time seems to be correct.

Accounts Receivable (A/R) is 209.2% of the Cash (i.e., 500/239), 45.7% of all the current assets (i.e., 500/1,095) and it has increased 25% (i.e., 500/400 - 1) since previous period x3. All those percentages seem to be considerable. The days of sales is 83 days (i.e., A/R / (Sales / 365) = 500 / (2,200/365)); that is, customers pay on average approximately 3 months later. That latency can be probably improved.

Accounts Payable (A/P) has increased 25% compared to the previous period x3 (i.e., 250/200 - 1). The days of COGS in A/P is 65.2 days (i.e., 250 / (COGS/365 = 1,400/365)); that means the company pays on average roughly in 2 months. Therefore, the company pays on average one month before their customers pay them. That is a disadvantage, specially when there is not a considerable large amount of cash which could cover any delays or unexpected events.

Non-current liabilities (i.e., 450) and Shareholder's equity (i.e., 596) cover the investment necessary for the non-current assets (i.e., 396) 1.76 times (i.e., (450+596)/396), which seems to be a positive situation. Since the buildings and equipment are very depreciated, the company could consider to invest some of the retained profits in such non-current assets.

The income statement is very positive: the Gross Margin is 36.4% (i.e., 800/2,200) of the total sales, the EBIT (Operating Margin) 22.8% (i.e., 501/2,200), and the Net Profit 15.3% (i.e., 336/2,200). All those seem to be very performant indicators.

The Cash Flow Statement is negative in total; the company has decreased its cash balance, as mentioned before. The reason is that the positive balance in the Cash Flow from Operations (i.e., CFO = 194) does not cover the negative balances of the Cash Flow from Investing (i.e., CFI= -115) and the Cash Flow from Financing (i.e., CFF = -180). By decreasing the A/P, i.e., by converting into cash the amount that the customers owe to the company, a better cash situation could be achieved.

> Q2. If you were a shareholder in Fibertech sitting in the Board of Directors, based on the information you read in the financial statements, what further relevant questions would you ask to get a more complete picture of the business performance? (7 items are possible in the solution, at least 4 must be discussed)

- Liquidity: The cash of the company has decreased (29.7%) but the A/R has increased (25%); additionally, the A/R consist in a 43.7% of all the current assets. Are there issues in charging customers or do some customers fail to pay? Which are the plans of the company to get the owed money from the customers sooner?

- The company pays on average one month before their customers pay them. That is a disadvantage, specially when there is not a considerable large amount of cash which could cover any delays or unexpected events. How is that issue being handled?

- The building and the equipment have suffered a large depreciation, being the present net value only 18.3% (i.e., 106/580). Which are the plans to renew future those non-current assets in the near? Which impacts will that have on the balance sheet?

- Retained profits increased a considerable percentage of 355% (i.e., 426/120). Which are the plans with it? Is part of this amoount going to be invested in new buildings and equipment?

- Are there seasonality effects in the market or in the markets associated to the suppliers which could explain why the A/R is so large, causing such a missmatch between profotability and liquidity?

- CFI is expected to increase (i.e., become more negative) if new buildings/equipment acquired. Which impact will that have in the cash flow statement?
