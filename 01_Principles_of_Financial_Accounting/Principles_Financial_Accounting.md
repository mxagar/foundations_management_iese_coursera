# Principles of Accounting

These are my notes on the Coursera course [Accounting: Principles of Financial Accounting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting?specialization=foundations-management), taught by Prof. Marc Badia.

The course explains in 4 weeks the 3 most important finance reports (balance, income, cash-flow) and explains additionally accrual accounting.

Overview:
1. The Balance Sheet
2. The Income Statement
3. The Cash Flow Statement
4. Accrual Accounting
