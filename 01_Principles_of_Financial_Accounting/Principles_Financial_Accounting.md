# Principles of Accounting

These are my notes on the Coursera course [Accounting: Principles of Financial Accounting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting?specialization=foundations-management), taught by Prof. Marc Badia.

The course explains in 4 weeks the 3 most important finance reports (balance, income, cash-flow) and explains additionally accrual accounting.

Overview:
1. Introduction
2. The Balance Sheet
3. The Income Statement
4. The Cash Flow Statement
5. Accrual Accounting

## 1. Introduction

Accounting is known as "the language of business".

The companz managers are the ones which record all economic events and transactions according to some standards and present it to interested parties. These interested parties are many:
- Current shareholders
- Potential shareholders
- Own comany workers who would like to negotiate their salary
- Customers who look for long-term product support
- Competitors
- ...

There is a conflict of interest: the company managers prepare the accounting reports and these are incentivized if the company shows to performs well; therefore, it is in their favor to show good reports. Hence, external auditors are required to supervise and certify that the reports are correct.

### Bookstore Case

We have the following case, taken from the PDF downloaded from the course:

1. On December 1st, Cristina incorporates the Campus Bookstore and together with her uncle, they contribute €50,000 of capital to the business.
2. Cristina negotiates a loan with the bank. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore receives a three-year bank loan of €20,000. The full amount of the principal has to be repaid at the end of the third year.
3. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore purchases furniture and equipment for €25,000 (€15,000 paid in cash and the rest to be paid in the coming year).
4. On December 31st, the Campus Bookstore acquires a bookstore management software for €3,000 paid in cash.
5. On December 15th, the Campus Bookstore purchases books on credit for a total amount of €40,000.
6. On December 31st, Cristina signs a one-year lease for the premises of the Campus Bookstore. The lease will start on January 1st and will end on December 31st of year x1. The Campus Bookstore prepays €6,000 for the full year rent.

Every business has a business cycle:

Cristina, the bookstore owner says she has all the receipts of the paymets she's done.
However, keeping track of all the payment receipts is not enough, because

- it does not reflect the full value of assets, only what has been paid for in cash
- it does not include how much money is owed
- it doesn't specify where the money is coming from (sources of capital)

#### Double Entry Accounting

In order to overcome the issues or lacks faced by a payments-based accounting, the **double entry accounting** is used in a table with two sides: **(1, right) the sources of capital and (2, left) uses of that capital**.

Main idea: any money entry on the right needs to reflect the use of that money on the left. Each side of the table is divided in different accounts. Thus, for every value transaction, at least 2 accounts need to be updated; however, these not always will be on different sides of the table.

In the following, all the 6 transactions/payments carried out to open the bookstore are reflected in the table and commented:

If we make the sum of each account and display the summary, we have our **balance sheet**, which is th emost important financial statement:

Note the following points:
- We have created **accounts** on both sides of the table:
  - Cash
  - Inventory
  - Equipment
  - Rent
  - Software
  - Loan
  - Common stock / Share capital
  - ...
- The sum on both sides of the table must be the same
- On entry in an account needs at least another entry in another account, which might be on the same side or on the other side
